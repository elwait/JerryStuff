## Logging onto cluster ##

# must be on campus or connected to UT VPN
# open a terminal window
# log in
ssh jlc8389@bme-jupiter.bme.utexas.edu
# go to node that everything is connected to
ssh bme-uranus
# go to whatever node you are running jobs on
ssh node154
# go to working directly which is currently
cd /home/jlc8389/REM_params/Sm
# source gaussian 16 bashrc
source ~/.g16.bashrc

## Download REM Paramterization Github Repository ##
git clone https://github.com/elwait/REMParameterization.git

## Stuff Requiring More Documentation Still ##
# excel sheet for new coordinates
# set up template
# have basis set info
# have element multiplicity info
# have conda

## Actually running scripts ##

## Running Jobs ##
# script will have created a file with lines for running jobs
cd ${working_directory}
tmux
nohup bash jobs.txt > jobs.out &
tmux detach

## Troubleshooting ##
# to check which jobs have finished or are running
ls -ltr */*log
# to check status of a job
tail put-element-here/*log
# check which have finished
grep "Normal termination" */*log
# check which jobs have crashed
grep "Error termination" */*log
# if a job has crashed
vi put-element-here/*com
# if not already there, add "XQC," in parentheses before "MaxCycles"
# if that has not worked, increase MaxCycles by 1000

# collecting results
# make sure you are in the directory that contains all the subfolders at the various distances
# edit collect_g16_energies.sh to make sure it has the correct rare earth element and ligand
bash collect_g16_energies.sh
# there should now be a csv file named in the format element_ligand_results.csv








## More General Stuff I Need to Add Docs For ##

opt
  have basis set for element in basissets folder
  have template file for opt
    starting structure, gaussian instructions
    assign basis set for non-REM atoms
    memory, etc
    example here:
  have element list with multiplicities
  run script that makes dirs for each element, prepares input files, and writes job file
  run La to make sure input runs
  remove La job line
  run job script to submit jobs

single point energies (QM)
  run script for extracting optimized structures and setting up single point dir
  use excel workbook to make translate/rotate opt structure so oxygen is at the origin and interaction is parallel to x axis
  make list of distances 
  put new structures in dir
  have template file
  run script to copy and edit template file and set up dirs for the various distances
  run script containing all the job lines
  run script that collects results
  plot resulting distance-dependent interaction energy curves

ForceBalance (MM parameterization)
  get MM param sets that let results match QM most closely
  select based on experimental data if available and necessary
  collect energies (using MM model)

MD Simulations
  ion...water
    hydration free energy
    hydration shells (Radial Distribution Function)
  ion...peptide interactions
