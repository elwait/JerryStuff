## Logging onto cluster ##

# must be on campus or connected to UT VPN

# log in
ssh jlc8389@bme-jupiter.bme.utexas.edu
# go to node that everything is connected to
ssh bme-uranus
# go to whatever node you are running jobs on
ssh node154












opt
  have basis set for element in basissets folder
  have template file for opt
    starting structure, gaussian instructions
    assign basis set for non-REM atoms
    memory, etc
    example here:
  have element list with multiplicities
  run script that makes dirs for each element, prepares input files, and writes job file
  run La to make sure input runs
  remove La job line
  run job script to submit jobs

single point energies (QM)
  run script for extracting optimized structures and setting up single point dir
  use excel workbook to make translate/rotate opt structure so oxygen is at the origin and interaction is parallel to x axis
  make list of distances 
  put new structures in dir
  have template file
  run script to copy and edit template file and set up dirs for the various distances
  run script containing all the job lines
  run script that collects results
  plot resulting distance-dependent interaction energy curves

ForceBalance (MM parameterization)
  get MM param sets that let results match QM most closely
  select based on experimental data if available and necessary
  collect energies (using MM model)

MD Simulations
  ion...water
    hydration free energy
    hydration shells (Radial Distribution Function)
  ion...peptide interactions
